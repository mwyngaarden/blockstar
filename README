Today's date is April 6, 2010.  This is BLOCKSTAR 1.02

BLOCKSTAR is a tetris clone written in platform-independent C++

BLOCKSTAR requires the SDL, SDL_gfx, and SDL_ttf headers and libraries
to build from source. BLOCKSTAR also requires that SDL, SDL_ttf, and
SDL_gfx libraries are present at run time.

For compiling instruction, see Makefile.



History
-------

December 1, 2010 BLOCKSTAR 1.0, First stable release

December 2, 2010 BLOCKSTAR 1.01, Unexplainable oversight

- It was pointed out to me by Professor Schemm that one of my 
  tetrominoes was in fact not a tetromino being that it consisted of 
  5 blocks.  I guess that would make it a pentomino?

April 6, 2012 BLOCKSTAR 1.02, Refactoring, Makefile, small changes to game play
