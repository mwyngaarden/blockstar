Intro
-----

BLOCKSTAR is a tetris clone.  It was compiled using:

g++ 4.6.1

SDL 1.2.14
SDL_gfx 2.0.22
SDL_ttf 2.0.9




Requirements
------------

BLOCKSTAR requires the SDL, SDL_ttf, and SDL_gfx libraries. If they 
were not included in your installion, you can download them from:

SDL, SDL_ttf:   http://www.libsdl.org/							  
SDL_gfx:        http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/


BLOCKSTAR runs best with a Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher resolution 
video adapter and monitor.  BLOCKSTAR may also require up to 8MB of 
memory and 2MB of hard disk space.




blockstar.cfg
-------------

This is the configuration file used by BLOCKSTAR.  With it you can
change the default game window size as well as the font size. Under
certain conditions, it may also be necessary to lower the FPS value,
that is, to reduce the number of frames that are rendered every second.

By default, the Frames Per Second is 100, the Square size is 24, and
font size is 12.  Feel free to change these to values that display the
game window and font to your liking.




blockstar.cpp blockstar.hpp main.cpp utility.cpp utility.hpp
------------------------------------------------------------

These are the source and header files used to compile BLOCKSTAR. 
Besides requiring the appropriate SDL, SDL_ttf, and SDL_gfx libraries
to build BLOCKSTAR.




Game Play
---------

To start the game, you will need to execute either BlockStar.exe or 
blockstar, depending on if your Operating System is Windows or
Linux.  Once started, the main menu should sppear.  From here you have
the option of (Q)uitting, starting a new (G)ame, or viewing the (H)igh
scores.  The parenthesis are to emphasize that you must press those 
keys to enter a new game, or view the high scores, etc.

Once a new game is started you will notice four status boxes on the 
right hand side of the game window.  These will display your score, 
current level, and the number of lines completed.  The next level is 
reached when you form ten solid horizontal lines.  The very last
status box displays the upcoming shape, that is, after you have set
your current shape into place, you can expect the next one to be the
shape displayed in the bottom status box.

To move the falling tetrominoes, you can use the arroy keys, left,
right, or down, or the 'a', 'd', or 's' keys.  To rotate the
tetromino, you can use the up arrow or the 'w' key.

The objective is to form as many sold horizontal lines as you can to 
reach the next level.  As you go up in levels, you are awarded more 
points for every solid horizontal you form.  You should also keep in 
mind that you are awarded more points for forming more solid lines at
the same time.  For example, forming one line in level one will award
you 40 points, two lines 100, three 300, and four lines yields 1200 
points.

The game is over when your tetrominoes reach the top of the game window
and there is no room to play any more.  At the end of the game you will 
have the option of saving your score with your three letter initials.
